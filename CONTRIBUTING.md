# Contributing to Cot

Cot welcomes contribution from everyone in the form of suggestions, bug
reports, pull requests, and feedback. This document gives some guidance if you
are thinking of helping us.

## Questions, feedback, and feature requests

If you have a question, feedback, or feature request, please open an
[issue](https://github.com/cot-rs/cot/issues/new),
a [discussion](https://github.com/cot-rs/cot/discussions/new/choose), or
join our [Discord server](https://discord.cot.rs/) to talk with us directly.

## Submitting issues

When reporting a bug or asking for help, please include enough details so that
the people helping you can reproduce the behavior you are seeing. For some tips
on how to approach this, read about how to produce a [Minimal, Complete, and
Verifiable example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve).

When making a feature request, please make it clear what problem you intend to
solve with the feature, any ideas for how Cot could support solving that
problem, any possible alternatives, and any disadvantages.

## Pull requests

We're happy to help you get started contributing to Cot. If you're looking for
a place to start, check out the
[good first issue](https://github.com/cot-rs/cot/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22)
label on the issue tracker. If you're looking for something more challenging,
check out the
[help wanted](https://github.com/cot-rs/cot/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22help%20wanted%22)
label, or just talk to us directly. We're happy to help you get started.

## Test suites, CI, and code style

We encourage you to check that the test suite passes locally before submitting a
pull request with your changes. If anything does not pass, typically it will be
easier to iterate and fix it locally than waiting for the CI servers to run
tests for you.

We are also using [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks to handle
formatting and linting. See the `pre-commit` website for installation
instructions. This handles formatting of all the files in the repository.

## Conduct

We follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
